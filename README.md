# Watchtower - 1-time hooks for sale

The demo instructions and video are [here](./demo/README.md).

## Abstract

This is a prototype of ***Watchtower***,  a novel protocol for atomic price action triggered interventions. Uniswap V4 Hooks have allowed this protocol to
react to price changes caused by executions of swaps. The reactions are atomic first-in-line without a possibility for anyone to intercept
and front-run the reacting transaction.

Watchtower allows for anyone to permissionlessly subscribe to desired price actions caused by swaps and and take advantage of the prompt atomic actions as
desired. Such actions can be delinquent loan liquidations, limit orders, undercollateralized option and/or derivative liquidations and many other use cases.

The implementation was facilitated by our One-time Hooks, which can be attached and detached dynamically to Uniswap V4 pools.
